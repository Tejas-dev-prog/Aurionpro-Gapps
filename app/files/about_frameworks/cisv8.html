  <p class="mb-2">
The Critical Security Controls (CIS 18) are a set of cybersecurity best practices developed by the Center for Internet Security (CIS). The controls are intended to be used by organizations to protect their information systems and networks from cyber-attacks. The 18 controls are organized into three categories: Basic, Foundational, and Organizational. The Basic controls focus on essential security measures such as patch management, secure configurations, and access control. The Foundational controls are more comprehensive, covering topics such as vulnerability management, data protection, and incident response. The Organizational controls are designed to help organizations develop a culture of security, with topics such as security awareness training and security policy development. The CIS 18 provides organizations with an actionable checklist of security best practices to help ensure the security of their networks.
